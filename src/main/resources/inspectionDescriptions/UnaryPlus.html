Reports any uses of the unary <b>+</b> operator. Unary plus is usually a null operation, and
its presence may represent a coding error, particularly in combination with the increment operator, <b>++</b>.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
Use the checkbox below to only report when an unary plus is used together with a binary or another unary expression.
This means the inspection won't warn when an unary plus expression is for example used as a variable initializer, as an argument to a method
or as the right-hand side of an assignment. In such cases it is much less confusing.
